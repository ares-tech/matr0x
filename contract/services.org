* Services
** ./scripts/forcesched.js
   This service will schedule users in waiting pool every 10 seconds, and put at most 10 users into
   waiting queue.
** ./scripts/rmexpired.js
   This service will run every 3 seconds. It will remove expired users in waiting queue (*schedtbl*).
** ./scripts/sendtokens.js
   This service will run every 3 seconds. It will scan *winnertal* and send awards to winner. Only *winnertbl*
   isn't empty, it will trigger transaction on the chain.


* Dockerize all the services: docker-compose.yml, Dockerfile

  All this three services are maintained by *docker-compose.yml* and set *restart=always*.
  So these services would be always online since the docker daemon is supervised by *systemd*
  in our server. Unless the machine is down, our containers can provide services in long run.
